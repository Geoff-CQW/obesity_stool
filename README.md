# obesity_stool

THe bacteria living in our bodies are affected by our body and can affect our body. There are even studies that show transplanting stool from obese mice to slim mice can make them fat and vice versa. So I'm curious if one can use the relative quantities of bacteria detected in the stool of individuals to predict if they are obese or not, and so here I try to classify observations into obese or normal-weight and do feature importance analysis to see if I can find any interesting bacteria that play an important role for the classification.
